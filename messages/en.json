    "infoGathering": "I began by reviewing existing scheduling apps, and conducting competitive analysis. This research helped me identify key user needs and pain points.",
    "prototypingTitle": "Prototyping",

    "improvementsTitle": "Improvements",

    "reflectionPoint2": "I received realistic advice for improvement that I need to consider not only available slots but also travel time. I learned not only to consider the usability and usability of the application, but also the perspective of what users want to use this application in what environment and for what purpose.",
    "reflectionPoint3": "As for the function to obtain location information of each individual, I felt that privacy concerns and the fact that some people register locations in their calendars while others do not, were challenges in connecting design with the real world."
